# Fruit Spin 4x4

This is a small client‑only slot demo built with React and Vite. It displays a 4×4 grid of emoji symbols and highlights winning lines.

## Development

Dependencies are listed in `package.json` but are not installed in this repository. Normally you would run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the Vite dev server.

The project includes basic Jest tests for the win‑detection utility:

```
npm test
```

Because the Codex environment has no internet access, dependencies cannot be installed here so the build and tests cannot run.
